# N Queens Problem

The N Queen problem's goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

Usage:
```
...$ ./0-nqueens.py <n>
[...]
[...]
...
```
The solutions are represented as a list of lists. Each inner list contains two integers [i,j][i,j], where ii is the row index and jj is the column index of a queen on the board.

### Useful Concepts
Here are the concepts you'd need to grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques in order to solve such a problem.
- Backtracking Algorithms
- Recursion
- List Manipulation
- Command Line Arguments

Since I'll be using python these concepts will be specific to it.
